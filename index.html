                    Something crazy to think about, or maybe not so crazy now since the increasing effects of climate change, is that Caribbean beaches don’t look the same way they used to 20 years ago. And we don’t mean coastal erosion due to infrastructure development in these areas, but a different threat: increasing accumulation of Sargasso blooms. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond the fact that the local government does not do enough to mitigate this problem locally, and that has been around since 2011, the yearly algal blooms are getting worse in the Atlantic Ocean. A new historical record for the month of May has been identified by the Optical Oceanography Laboratory, University of South Florida.

                    The great Atlantic Sargassum Belt, which extends across the tropical Atlantic, the Caribbean Sea, the Central West Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico, accumulated approximately 14 million tons of this algae in April 2022, which increased to 18.8 million tons in May, exceeding all previous records for this month.

                    Beaching events have already started around the Caribbean nations and islands, as local news outlets have reported since April. May’s bulletin states that “Sargassum amount will likely continue to increase in June – July, but this trend may reverse in July – August based on the historical record”, which means that Sargassum amount has a good chance of setting a new historical record in 2022.

                <p>
                    Where is all this algae coming from? The answer is the Sargasso Sea, which is a North Atlantic ecosystem that has been documented in scientific publications since 1854, according to the Sargasso Sea Commission.  Scientists in the Caribbean and near continental countries address the abnormal bloom increase as a normal and cyclical phenomena that has worsened for two main reasons. One is the Atlantic Ocean surface temperature increase of 0.075 degrees Celsius (.135 degrees Fahrenheit), a faster increase than the average between 1981 and 2010. Second is the oceanic intake of nutrients from continental runoff depositing high levels of nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen. Nonetheless, even for scientists, it is still a mystery where these nutrients are coming from and why it has been happening since 2011.

                        The root of this fenomena may be unknown, but scientists have come up with the conclusion that beaching events are here to stay, which has led to the creation of local and regional efforts around the Caribbean and Central America. In Puerto Rico, nevertheless, there’s much work still to be done to address this issue that has been progressively increasing.
